   # Point to the `dist` directory
   ```

## Post-Deployment

### 1. **Verify Deployment**
- [ ] Check that site loads correctly
- [ ] Test Base Pay integration
- [ ] Verify mainnet transactions
- [ ] Test campaign creation and sharing

### 2. **Monitor**
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Monitor transaction success rates
- [ ] Track user engagement
- [ ] Monitor performance

### 3. **Security**
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set up CSP headers
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Important Notes

### ðŸš¨ **Critical Security Considerations**

1. **Wallet Security**
   - Use a dedicated wallet for receiving funds
   - Consider multi-sig wallets for large amounts
   - Never expose private keys

2. **Smart Contract Interactions**
   - All payments go through Base Pay (secure)
   - No custom smart contracts needed
   - USDC is the payment token

3. **Data Storage**
   - Currently using localStorage (client-side only)
   - Consider upgrading to proper database for production
   - Implement data backup strategies

### ðŸ’° **Financial Considerations**

1. **Gas Fees**
   - Base Pay handles gas fees
   - Users pay in USDC
   - No additional gas costs for your app

2. **Transaction Fees**
   - Base Pay may charge small fees
   - Factor into your business model
   - Monitor fee structures

### ðŸ“ˆ **Scaling Considerations**

1. **Database**
   - Replace localStorage with proper database
   - Consider PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Supabase
   - Implement proper data models

2. **Backend API**
   - Add server-side validation
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add email notifications

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Use CDN for static assets

## Recommended Upgrades for Production

### 1. **Database Integration**
```bash
# Example with Supabase
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 2. **Analytics**
```bash
# Google Analytics
npm install gtag

# Mixpanel
npm install mixpanel-browser
```

### 3. **Error Tracking**
```bash
# Sentry
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/vite-plugin
```

### 4. **Email Notifications**
```bash
# EmailJS or similar
npm install @emailjs/browser
```
